## Stack
- Java 21, Maven, Spring Boot 4
- HTTPS api calls
- No database interaction (no jOOQ, no JPA/Hibernate)

## Architecture
- REST controllers → services 

## Conventions
- Constructor injection only (`@RequiredArgsConstructor`); no field injection
- Use `@Slf4j`; `log.debug()` for row-level detail, `log.error()` + rethrow on failures
- jOOQ only for DB access: `table(name("..."))`, `field(name("..."))`; no schema prefixes, no raw SQL
- Always use `idGenerator.getId("table_name", "id_column")` for OMOP PKs
- Prefix log messages and comments with the Jira ticket (e.g. `// HDQ-42:`)
- Mark replaced code `@Deprecated`; leave it in place for reference

## Terminal Output Handling

Due to IDE limitations, terminal output may not be visible to the agent.

When executing terminal commands:

1. Always redirect stdout and stderr to a file in the project root.
2. Use deterministic filenames.
3. Read the file to inspect results instead of relying on terminal output.
4. Remove files after processing to avoid clutter.

## JIRA Workflow Rules (mcp-atlassian)

When working on any task associated with a JIRA ticket, you MUST follow these rules strictly:

### Planning Phase
- **ALWAYS** begin by documenting a detailed implementation plan as a comment on the associated JIRA ticket before touching any code
- The plan comment must include:
  - Summary of the problem/feature
  - Files that will be created or modified
  - Approach and reasoning
  - Any risks or dependencies identified
  - Any suggestions to add to the implementation plan for future reference
- Planning Phase may proceed without approval.

### Approval Gate
- **NEVER** make any code changes until the plan comment on the JIRA ticket has received explicit approval
- Approval is defined as a comment from an authorized team member containing words like "approved", "LGTM", or "go ahead"
- If no approval exists, stop and remind the user that the plan must be approved before proceeding

### Implementation Phase
- If branch does not match the JIRA ticket you are working on, or if the branch is main, alert user before continuing with any code changes. wait for user confirmation before proceeding.
- **ALWAYS** follow the approved plan exactly; any deviations must be documented as a new comment and approved before implementation
- If you encounter any blockers or new information during implementation, document it as a comment on the JIRA ticket and seek approval for any changes to the plan
- once implementation is complete, add a comment summarizing the work done and any remaining tasks or follow-ups needed
- Never commit or push code.
- Once implementation is complete, generate a detailed implementation report as a comment on the JIRA ticket, including:
  - Summary of the work done
  - Files modified or created
  - Any remaining tasks or follow-ups needed
  - Any lessons learned or suggestions for future improvements

### Ticket Transitions
- **NEVER** transition a JIRA ticket status under any circumstances
- Do not call any MCP transition or status-change operations on JIRA tickets
- Leave all ticket transitions to be performed manually by the team

### General JIRA Etiquette
- Only add comments — never edit or delete existing comments
- Always reference the ticket key (e.g., PROJ-123) in any commit messages or PR descriptions
- Do not assign or reassign tickets
